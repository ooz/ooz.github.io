Hey! I am Oliver, a Software Engineer at [ePages](https://www.epages.com/).
When not sitting infront of computers I like doing various sports (Shotokan Karate, BWE, Yoga, running, swimming etc.), messing around with Lego bricks and playing the <del>guitar</del> ukulele.

### What's the deal with the logo/avatar?

It's a modified version of the [German Naturschutzgebiet (nature reserve) sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturschutzgebiet).
Since the original image is in the public domain,
I could crop it to look like a selfie and add the letter `z` in succession of the `oo` owl eyes to match my GitHub handle [`ooz`](https://github.com/ooz).
