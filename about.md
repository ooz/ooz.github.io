Hey, I'm Oliver, a Software Engineer and Computer Scientist (M.Sc.) living in Germany. Nice to have you as a reader!
When not sitting in front of computers, I like doing various sports (Shotokan Karate, BWE, Yoga, running etc.) and messing around with Lego bricks.

This site and blog grow continuously, so it may happen that old things get updated/changed.
[Blog updates can be subscribed to via RSS](https://oliz.io/blog/rss.xml).
If you want to give feedback or comment on one of my posts, feel free to write me an email (see **Imprint** below).

Where else to find me:

### What's the deal with the logo/avatar?

It's a modified version of the [German Naturschutzgebiet (nature reserve) sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturschutzgebiet).
Since the original image is in the public domain,
I could crop it to look like a selfie and add the letter `z` in succession of the `oo` owl eyes to match my GitHub handle [`ooz`](https://github.com/ooz).
